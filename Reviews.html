We brought Patrick and his crew in to put the final touches on a comprehensive pool, hardscape, irrigation, sod, and full yard landscape install project. After 6 months of pool and hardscape taking place at our home, we hired Patrick to complete the landscape for our project. We found his prices to be very reasonable, responses to be timely in every instance, and their work to be excellent. After having our yard under construction and having dealt with many contractors throughout the project the best compliment I can give Patrick and the crew is they are very professional and were an absolute pleasure to have at our home. Patrick’s crew was by far the best contractors we had at our home. I have a very active and involved family…. Kids checking out their work, interacting with the guys….. They were just great and we would recommend Great Atlantic Landscapes to anyone who is looking for #1 Great Service #1.1 Great work and beautiful plants #1.2 Great Value" <br /> ~Dave Hodgemen </p>

                   "Having used Great Atlantic multiple times at my own residence, I can attest to their desire to provide a professional and high quality service no matter the job. Patrick and his team work tirelessly to meet the needs and vision of their clients and do not finish a job until the customer is completely satisfied. I am consistently impressed with the team's knowledge and attention to detail when it comes to their work. I would not hesitate to recommend Great Atlantic to anyone in need of landscaping repairs or renovations." <br /> ~Carson Cashwell </p>

For specialty projects like rock landscaping or general yard applications, we trust Patrick and his team to not only meet our desires and expectations, but exceed them every single time.
